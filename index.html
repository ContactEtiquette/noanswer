  <h1>Please Read When Contacting Me</h1>

  <h2>TL;DR</h2>
  <p>On a normal business day I am in meetings for a majority of my time. 
  Modern chat communication on the other hand seems to imply I am always reacheable and you might get the impression I do not answer you.
  Please don’t expect an answer if you just write “Hello” in chat OR if I am busy working on something.
  Also I use several screens and you message may have not popped up into my field of view just yet.
  Be patient I usually get to you within the next days.</p>
