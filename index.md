# Please Read When Contacting Me

## TL;DR
On a normal business day I am in meetings for a majority of my time. 
Modern chat communication on the other hand seems to imply I am always reacheable and you might get the impression I do not answer you.
Please don’t expect an answer if you just write “Hello” in chat OR if I am busy working on something.
Also I use several screens and you message may have not popped up into my field of view just yet.
Be patient I usually get to you within the next days.

## When you need to talk to me
If you really need to talk to me, schedule a meeting.
My calendar is **always** up to date, so feel free to book a meeting with me.
Though please wait for my response to you invite too.

## Meeting Etiquette
Do not ask me when I have time. Instead just check out my calendar and pick some free slot to schedule a meeting.
When you schedule a meeting please provide enough in the description for me to understand what you want to talk about.
But please do not just send a link saying 'read this'.
