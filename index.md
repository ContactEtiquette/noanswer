# Please Read When Contacting Me

# TL;DR

On a normal business day I am in meetings for a majority of my time. 
Modern chat communication on the other hand seems to imply I am always reacheable and you might get the impression I do not answer you.
Please don’t expect an answer if you just write “Hello” in chat OR if I am busy working on something.
Also I use several screens and you message may have not popped up into my field of view just yet.
Be patient I usually get to you within the next days.
